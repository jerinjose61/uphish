<h3>What is uphish?</h3>
<p>
  uphish is an open source app which can be used to run phishing campaigns.
</p>

<p>
  Phishing campaigns are basically mock phishing attacks on your employees. The primary objective is to make the employees aware about phishing attacks and the resulting damages. It also helps the security team measure the effectiveness of their training over time.
</p>

<p>
  Ideally,
</p>
<p>1. the number of employees who fall for the phishing attack should decrease over time</p>
<p>2. the number of employees who report the phishing attack should increase over time</p>

<p>Running & tracking a phishing campaign manually is a tedious job. To be effective, you need a tool.</p>
